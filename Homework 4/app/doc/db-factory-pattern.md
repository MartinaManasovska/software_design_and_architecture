Overview
The Factory Pattern is implemented for database connections, providing a flexible way to create and manage different types of database connections.

Implementation Details

Abstract Base Class
python
class DatabaseConnection(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def connect(self):
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def disconnect(self):
        pass


Concrete Implementation

class SQLiteConnection(DatabaseConnection):
    def __init__(self, db_name):
        self.db_name = db_name
        self.connection = None
    
    def connect(self):
        try:
            self.connection = sqlite3.connect(self.db_name)
            self.connection.row_factory = sqlite3.Row
            return self.connection
        except sqlite3.Error as e:
            print(f"Database connection error: {e}")
            return None


Factory Class

class DatabaseFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def get_database(db_type, db_name):
        if db_type.lower() == "sqlite":
            return SQLiteConnection(db_name)
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported database type: {db_type}")


Benefits of Factory Pattern
1. Flexibility
   - Easy to add new database types
   - Simple to switch between different databases
   - Supports testing with mock databases

2. Encapsulation
   - Database connection details are hidden
   - Consistent interface for all database types
   - Centralized error handling

Pattern Integration

The two patterns work together effectively:
1. The Factory Pattern creates database connections used by the Model
2. The Model uses these connections to access data
3. The Controller coordinates data flow between Model and View
4. The View displays the processed data to users

Code Example of Pattern Integration
python
In DataModel (Model component using Factory Pattern)
class DataModel:
    def __init__(self):
        self.db = DatabaseFactory.get_database("sqlite", "updated_stocks_database.db")
    
    def get_db_connection(self):
        return self.db.connect()

In DataController (Controller component using Model)
class DataController:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = DataModel()

    def get_stock_data(self, request):
        # Process request and use model to fetch data
        return self.model.fetch_stock_data_from_db(...)


Why These Patterns?

1. MVC Pattern
   - Perfect for web applications with clear separation of concerns
   - Supports multiple views of the same data
   - Makes the application more maintainable and scalable
   - Facilitates parallel development

2. Factory Pattern
   - Provides flexibility in database selection
   - Makes testing easier with mock databases
   - Centralizes database connection management
   - Supports future expansion to different database types

Future Improvements

1. MVC Enhancements
   - Add more views for different data visualizations
   - Implement caching in the Model layer
   - Add view models for complex data transformations

2. Factory Pattern Extensions
   - Add support for PostgreSQL and MySQL
   - Implement connection pooling
   - Add monitoring and logging features

 
Conclusion
The combination of MVC and Factory patterns creates a robust, maintainable, and flexible application architecture. MVC provides the overall structure, while the Factory Pattern handles database connectivity in a clean and extensible way. Together, they create a solid foundation for future development and scaling.
